# Hey, this is Adah!
Currently, I'm working on a bunch of websites for various out of school activities, and I'm taking this class to understand even more about what goes on behind the scenes of the website. Wordpress is great, but limited in what it can do by itself, and knowing as much as I can about coding would be incredibly useful.  

I do have prior experience with both Javascript and HTML, but it's been a minute since I've played around with coding, and I'm excited to get a more comprehensive knowledge of these languages.  

I play violin and compose classical music, which takes up most of my time, but I also am a News Desk Editor for the Edition here at GA, and volunteer as website designer/manager for a couple of small organizations outside of school.  

My goals in this class are to learn as much as I can about the structure of websites and how I can utilize that knowledge in a website-making platform.  

I'm a little worried that I'll run out of ideas for my Interest-Driven Projects??
